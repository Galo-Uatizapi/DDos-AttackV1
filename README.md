# What is a DDos attack?

In a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, an attacker overloads their target with unwanted internet traffic so that normal traffic cannot reach its intended destination.
But what does that really mean? Imagine your favorite zombie movie. Hordes of infected creatures, all with the same goal: to ravage civilization while spreading their "zombie plague".
They flood the resources of public security agencies, destroy military forces and disable health services. Then, inevitably, there is a huge traffic jam that reaches as far as the eye can see.
while people flee on the road to be safe. A DDoS attack is like this: an online zombie apocalypse. But instead of zombies, hordes of infected computers go after a website directed, all at the same time, pushing humans and business away.

A DDoS attack on a company's website, web application, APIs, network, or data center infrastructure can cause downtime and prevent legitimate users from purchasing products, use a service, obtain information, or otherwise access.

During a DDoS attack, attackers use many exploited machines and internet connected devices, including IoT (Internet of Things) devices, smartphones, personal computers and network servers, to send a flood of traffic to targets.
